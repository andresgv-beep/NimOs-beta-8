# NimOS Beta 6

NimOS is a custom NAS operating system built from scratch with a Go daemon backend and SvelteKit frontend. Designed for personal use on bare-metal Linux machines.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go daemon (~17 files, ~10 MB binary, ~2 MB RAM)
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (compiled static files served by the daemon)
- **Reverse proxy**: Nginx (HTTPS with Let's Encrypt)
- **Torrent**: C++ daemon using libtorrent-rasterbar
- **No external dependencies**: No Docker required for core functionality

---

## What works (production-ready)

### Storage engine (rewritten from scratch in Beta 6)

- **ZFS pools**: Create, destroy, mount on boot — mirror / raidz1 / raidz2 / stripe
- **BTRFS pools**: Create, destroy, mount on boot (fstab) — single / raid1 / raid10
- **Disk wipe**: TrueNAS-style wipe with verification — zeros start+end, sgdisk, wipefs, partition-level cleanup, 3-attempt retry
- **Pre-flight safety**: Boot disk protection, kernel holder check, serial verification
- **ZFS snapshots**: Create, list, delete, rollback (UI included)
- **ZFS scrub**: Start, progress monitoring (UI included)
- **ZFS datasets**: Create, list, delete with quotas
- **BTRFS subvolumes**: Per-share subvolumes with qgroup quotas
- **Quota management**: Set and change quotas live on both ZFS and BTRFS
- **Journal**: Atomic writes (tmp+fsync+rename), phase tracking (started/completed), crash recovery
- **Operations engine**: Step-based with rollback, error policies (FailFast/Continue/Ignore), exclusive mutex lock

### Shared folders

- Create shared folders as ZFS datasets or BTRFS subvolumes (not plain mkdir)
- Per-folder quota with live adjustment
- File stats by category (video / image / audio / document / other)
- Usage monitoring with donut chart in UI
- User permissions (read-only / read-write / no access)
- SMB, NFS, FTP protocol tags

### Networking

- DDNS support (DuckDNS, No-IP, Dynu, FreeDNS)
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (auto-renewal)
- Reverse proxy for Docker apps
- Port exposure management
- Remote access portal

### Security

- 2FA/TOTP authentication
- User management with roles (admin / user)
- App permissions system (user × app access grid)
- Session-based auth with Bearer tokens
- Passed external pentest: **0 CRIT / 0 FAIL / 61 PASS** from internet

### Apps & services

- **File Manager**: Browse, upload, download files from shares
- **NimTorrent**: Native C++ BitTorrent client — downloads only to pool shares (no system disk access)
- **Media Player**: Built-in media playback
- **Docker Apps**: Install via App Store, run in iframes with reverse proxy
- **Notes**: Simple note-taking app

### System

- **OTA Updates**: Push to GitHub repo → one-click update from UI (auto-rebuild Go + frontend)
- **Hardware monitoring**: CPU, RAM, disk, temperature, GPU (NVIDIA/AMD)
- **System panel**: Service management, resource monitoring

---

## What's in progress

### Storage (functional but needs polish)

- Orphan directory cleanup (works on destroy, not on startup)
- BTRFS snapshot scheduler (ZFS manual snapshots work)
- Expand pool (add disk to existing pool)
- Import external ZFS pool
- Hardware vs config reconciliation at boot (FOREIGN/MISSING/OK states)
- SMART disk monitoring

### NimTorrent

- Auto-update download_dir when pools change
- Speed optimization (was limited by wrong pool paths before — now fixed)

### NimBackup

- UI shell exists, backend not implemented
- Planned: device pairing, remote folder sync, scheduled backups

---

## Hardware tested on

- **NAS**: Z370 AORUS Ultra Gaming, 15 GB RAM, Intel CPU
  - sda: Toshiba 1.8 TB SATA (HDD)
  - sdb: Seagate 3.6 TB SATA (HDD)
  - sdc: 447 GB SSD (boot)
- **Target platforms**: x86_64 bare-metal, Raspberry Pi (BTRFS only — ZFS needs more RAM)

## Key design decisions

1. **No Docker for core**: Storage, shares, auth, networking — all native Go. Docker only for user-installed apps.
2. **ZFS + BTRFS**: Two filesystem options. ZFS for features (datasets, native quota, snapshots). BTRFS for lightweight setups (Raspberry Pi).
3. **Verification over trust**: Every operation verifies its result. Wipe checks `lsblk`, mount checks `findmnt`, pool create checks `zpool list`. Exit codes are not trusted.
4. **No system disk writes**: Every file operation validates the target is on a mounted pool, not the boot disk.
5. **Crash recovery**: Journal with phase tracking. If the daemon crashes mid-operation, it knows exactly where it stopped.
